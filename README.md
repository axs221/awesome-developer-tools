## [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Spotlight search alternative

  - Clipboard manager with search history
  - Snippets with some scripting and templating capabilities
  - Search for Chrome or Safari bookmarks

## [Shift](https://tryshift.com/) - Interface container for Gmail/Inbox, Google Calendar, Google Drive

  - There are many good alternatives, but notifications never seem to work for me for the alternatives, for example:
    - Franz
    - Station
    - WaveBox

# Web Browsers

## Chrome

### Extensions

#### [Tab Wrangler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-wrangler/egnjhciaieeiiohknchakcodbpgjnchh) - Auto clean up inactive tabs

  - Very customizable
  - Saves closed tabs into a searchable list

#### [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) - Send SMS from Chrome, or push files to or from your phone

#### [Pin Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pin-tab/dgldedkigbbalaioohedddpameekglma) - Simply pin the current tab in one click

  - Good to use with Tab Wrangler, since Tab Wrangler doesn't close pinned tabs

#### [cVim](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cvim/ihlenndgcmojhcghmfjfneahoeklbjjh) - Vim hotkeys for Chrome

  - Navigate page with h/j/k/l/g/G

# Text Editors

## Vim

### Plugins

#### [Vim-Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - Git integration with Vim

  - Git Blame view where you can press Enter to jump to commit before a change was made to a line.
  - Git Status, Git Diff, etc

#### [Vim-Dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch) - Execute commands in a Tmux pane

  - Pulls results into Vim for easy paging and searching
  
#### [Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) - Text-completion snippets with templating and scripting support


#### [Vim-Quickly](https://github.com/axs221/vim-quickly) - FZF jump-to-file alternative

  - CtrlP-like jump-to-file functionality, sorting by most recently used, visited, etc. A plugin I made that is similar to FZF, but uses more native Vim features like the quicklist for easy paging.

#### [Vim-Dirvish](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-dirvish) - Minimal file manager, light-weight alternative to NERDtree.

  - Easy to script or run commands against selected files.
